Hi! I'm Huyen, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn) and Research Assistant at [VinUni - Illinois Smart Health Center](https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn) (VISHC), supervised by [Dr Hieu Pham](https://huyhieupham.github.io). My research focuses on AI in Biomedical Imaging. 

I received my double-major Bachelor degree in Applied Information Engineering and International Commerce at [Yonsei University](http://www.yonsei.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) in February 2023. I was a software engineering at Smallmachines, South Korea from January 2023 to February 2024.

News
------
- **[Aug. 2024]** I started a Ph.D. in Computer Science at VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center, VinUniversity, with full-ride scholarship.
- **[Jun. 2024]** One [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17926) "SarcNet: A Novel AI-based Framework to Automatically Analyze and Score Sarcomere Organizations  in Fluorescently Tagged hiPSC-CMs" was selected for an invited talk at [BME10](https://bme.hcmiu.edu.vn/bme10/) Conference 2024 in Phan Thiet, Vietnam.
- **[Feb. 2024]** I joined VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center (VISHC) as Research Assistant under supervison of Dr. Hieu Pham. My research focus is on AI for Biomedical Imaging, in particular, quantifying sarcomere organization in fluorescently tagged human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). My work is a part of the project: Evaluate the Effectiveness of Anti-viral Drug using Polarized Light Imaging. 
- **[Dec. 2023]** One patent: Choi Jun Kyu, You Jung Min, Le Minh Huyen, Lee Ju Hun. “Sepsis early diagnosis and prognosis prediction system and the method thereof” has been submitted to Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO).
- **[Nov. 2023]** I attended [MEDICA 2023](https://www.medica-tradefair.com), one of the world largest medical B2B trade fairs, held in Düsseldorf, Germany.
- **[Jan. 2023]** I joined Smallmachines, a medical device manufacturing company based in Seoul, Korea, as a Software Engineer. My work focused on developing ML models for sepsis early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as building a website and mobile app to deploy these ML models.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
